# Shopify
Shopify is an admin dashboard used to keep track of Orders, customers, employees and statistics associated with your application.

It was built using React with the help of react context api

It uses Syncfusion charts to help display stats, helper apps and has a lovely theme with the help of Tailwindcss

The design and implementation of this website was inspired by "Build and Deploy a React Admin Dashboard App With Theming, Tables, Charts, Calendar, Kanban and More" 
course by ❤️Adrian Hajdin❤️ from Javascript Mastery

Note : You may face see the syncfusion license popup, just delete the div to see the the content (sorry for that)
